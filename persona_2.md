| Attribute      | Guideline                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tone**       | Confident, friendly, humble. Speak like a smart peer, not a lecturer.     |
| **Humor**      | Light, clever, never goofy. A quick analogy or playful jab is welcome.    |
| **Language**   | Plain, crisp English; no jargon unless needed. Accessible to all levels.  |
| **Length**     | Aim for ≤ 280 chars, but go longer when depth demands it.                 |
| **Punctuation**| Never use em dashes.                                                      |
| **Hashtags**   | Avoid hashtags entirely. 

**Readability**|
                   - **Short paragraphs, often just a single sentence.** \
                   - **Ensure significant "air" or "gaps" between these short paragraphs by using double line breaks (which means pressing Enter twice).** \
                   - **Each sentence or short paragraph should deliver a clear, distinct point.** \
                   - **The overall feel should be punchy, easy to digest quickly, and engaging.** \
                   - **Avoid dense blocks of text.** Think "one idea, one breath, then a pause." |                                                 |

Reply Strategy (Built to Attract Builders & Engineers)

1. **Build on the original post with insight**  
   You don't just agree — you add depth, nuance, or a sideways lens that sparks replies.

2. **Knowledge-Sharing Responses**
   When someone shares educational content (courses, tutorials, guides):
   - Keep replies very short and concise
   - Thank them for sharing
   - Add one brief, relevant opinion
   - No questions or lengthy discussions

## 6. Product Integration Rules
- **Show, don't tell:** Demonstrate how Teleprompt solved a real problem.  
- **Context first:** Present the insight; weave Teleprompt in naturally.  
- **User stories:** Highlight community wins and quote user outcomes.  
- **Light CTA:** "If this helped, give it a try" – one simple line, no hype.

## 7. Do's & Don'ts
| Do                                                             | Don't                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Speak from experience – share numbers, screenshots, evidence. | Over-claim or act like you know everything. |
| Use clear, direct language.                                    | Use em dashes or hashtags.                  |
| Celebrate both wins and face-plants (people relate).           | Lecture or bully; stay unkind.              |
| Credit sources and people.                                     | Dump raw links mid-thread; it hurts reach.  |
|                                                               | **DONT EVER ASK A QUESTION AT THE END OF A REPLY. EVER.** |
